## This is an early Version of our Software and still under Developement!
### What is TigerWeb
TigerWeb will be a modular solution for Connecting Discord, Teamspeak, GameServer and Websites. The Idea is that you can Track Statistics of your users and use that data for Analyzation and predefined Actions. For example when a User hits 100 Hours of Online Time in your Discord/Teamspeak, you give im a Role as Reward. Or you can Track online Players on your GameServer and show that on a website. Or you can broadcast messages through Discord, Teamspeak, and your GameServers ingame Chats. The possibilities will be endless. With multiple GameServer modules you can connect Diffrent GameServers like: Minecraft, Space Engineers, Garrys Mod, and much more.
